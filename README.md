#### Step 1. When inside the editor, select all the actors you want to convert to a playset, right click and press "Convert to Playset"

<hr>

#### Step 2. This will then show up the PlaysetConvert in which you can specifiy some properties of the Playset.
  -  **Name**: Will be later used for the label inside the Playset Browser.
  -  **Description (Short/Long)**: Will either show up as a tooltip in the Playser Browser or as the asset details in the Content Browser.
  -  **Icon (Small/Large)**: Will be used for a custom thumbnail.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the playset doesnt save any modified properties or changes that were done to instances of the selected actors, as the Playset will use the class default object.

#### Result
After saving the Playset it should now appear in the Content Browser (Including custom thumbnails, asset descriptions, etc.)
